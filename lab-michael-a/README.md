#Project Description!

This project is building routes and tests for a full CRUD API using MongoDB to create, read, update, destroy information on food types, description, foodGroups...

Tests are passing, throwing errors depending on how the information is sent as a request to the server.

Another thing to add would be some sweet middleware!
